HOW TO RUN

This CD includes all source files and assets used in our project,
as included under the src/ directory.

This game is delivered as an executable (.exe) file for Windows
platforms. Upon double-clicking "Fungus.exe", you should
be prompted to set up a customized configuration. No further setup is
necessary, simply play the game!

NOTE: Files must be taken off the CD and onto a local drive in order
